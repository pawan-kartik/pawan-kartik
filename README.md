### Hi!

I'm Pawan Kartik, a postgraduate student at The University of Manchester where I focus on Programming Languages, Compilers, Static Analysis, and Databases. In addition to these formal subjects, my Master's thesis is on Implementing Programming Languages and Compiler Optimisations for JVM using Truffle and Graal for which I'm implementing C# on GraalVM via Truffle.

Prior to my Master's, I worked at DeepSource for about 2-2.5 years where I was responsible for building and maintaining their C# and Scala static code analysers from the ground up.

If you're a PL enthusiast and/or would like to have a chat, please send me an email at pawankartikc@gmail.com!
